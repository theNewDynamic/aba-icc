### Factual Allegations

*This case arises from the Accused's actions in connection with the case of [<u>The Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo</u>](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba/), in which Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo was charged, tried, and convicted of crimes against humanity (murder, rape) and war crimes (murder, rape, and pillaging) at the ICC.&nbsp;*

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo’s former primary political advisor Fid&egrave;le Babala Wandu participated in a scheme, devised by Mr. Bemba, to transfer financial compensation to defense witnesses in exchange for false evidence (false testimony and false or forged documents\*) favorable to the defense of Mr. Bemba in the case of [*The Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo*](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba/). (\*Pre-Trial Chamber II declined to confirm the charge of false or forged documents.)

From 2012 to November 14, 2013, Mr. Babala, as alleged by the OTP, following conversations with Mr. Bemba, made transfers of money to defense witnesses. Mr. Babala personally and through his chauffeur also made transfers of money to lead defense counsel [Aim&eacute; Kilolo Musamba](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/aime-kilolo-musamba/) and defense case manager [Jean-Jacques Mangenda Kabongo](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/jean-jacques-magenda-kabongo/).&nbsp;
