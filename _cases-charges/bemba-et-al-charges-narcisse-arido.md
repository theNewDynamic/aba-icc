### Factual Allegations

*This case arises from the Accused’s actions in connection with the case of [<u>The Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo</u>](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba/), in which Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo was charged, tried, and convicted of crimes against humanity (murder, rape) and war crimes (murder, rape, and pillaging) at the ICC.&nbsp;*

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) alleges that Narcisse Arido, though initially recruited as an expert witness on military operations in the CAR by lead defense counsel [Aim&eacute; Kilolo Musamba](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/aime-kilolo-musamba/), participated in a scheme, devised by Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, to transfer financial compensation to defense witnesses in exchange for false testimony and false or forged documents\* favorable to the defense of Mr. Bemba in the case of [*The Prosecutor v. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo*](https://www.aba-icc.org/cases/case/the-prosecutor-v-bemba/). (\*Pre-Trial Chamber II declined to confirm the charge of false or forged documents.)

From 2012 to November 14, 2013, Mr. Arido, as alleged by the OTP, recruited other defense witnesses to falsely testify that they were members of CAR armed forces (when they were not), coached their testimonies, and transferred money to them. Mr. Arido also relayed messages between Mr. Kilolo and the recruited defense witnesses and received transfers of money from Mr. Kilolo, Mr. Bemba’s former primary political advisor [Fid&egrave;le Babala Wandu](https://www.aba-icc.org/accused/fid-le-babala-wandu/), and Mr. Babala’s chauffeur.&nbsp;
