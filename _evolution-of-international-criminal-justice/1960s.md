**May 11, 1960-May 31, 1962**

After Israeli secret police arrested him in Argentina, Adolf Eichmann is prosecuted and convicted in Israeli courts for the ruthless extermination of millions of Jews during World War II. It marked the first conviction for genocide (retroactively) and a seminal moment in the use of universal jurisdiction by a national jurisdiction for international atrocity crimes.

**1943-1945**

The United States and its Allies signed the [Moscow Declaration of 1943](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/moscow.asp) and the [Potsdam Declaration of 1945](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/decade17.asp), which discussed the need to punish war crimes committed by German and Japanese governments respectively.

**1945-1946**

Following World War II, the Allies set up the [Nuremberg](http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_Vol-I.pdf) and [Tokyo](http://www.legal-tools.org/uploads/tx_ltpdb/CHARTER_OF_THE_INTERNATIONAL_MILITARY_TRIBUNAL_FOR_THE_FAR_EAST.pdf) tribunals to try German and Japanese war leaders, respectively. Among other principles, these trials confirmed that individuals could be held criminally responsible for international crimes, regardless of official position, and that superiors' orders were not a full defense to criminal behavior.

**1948**

December 9, 1948: The United Nations General Assembly adopted the [Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide](http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/cppcg/cppcg.html), which called for perpetrators of genocide to be tried before international penal tribunals. Following the adoption of the Convention, the General Assembly invited the International Law Commission to explore the possibility of establishing an international judicial organ to try those charged with genocide. The Commission concluded that such a judicial organ was both possible and desirable, and a subsequent committee drafted statutes in 1951 and 1954\. Despite these early efforts, the General Assembly postponed considering the question, and the Cold War prevented further development of international criminal law for several decades.

**1949**

August 12, 1949: Led by the International Committee of the Red Cross, a Diplomatic Conference in Geneva, Switzerland adopted the [Geneva Conventions of 1949](http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/). The original four conventions were followed by Additional Protocols I and II on June 8, 1977\. These conventions form the backbone of international humanitarian law and are binding customary international law on all States and other actors in armed conflict. Each convention provides special protection to a group of designated persons, including civilians, aid workers, the wounded, and others no longer taking part in active hostilities. The [Fourth Geneva Convention](http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b36d2.html) specifically outlines protection owed to civilians in armed conflict. Additionally, the [“grave breaches" regime](http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/5zmgf9.htm) they created (wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, unlawful deportation or transfer of protected persons, hostage-taking, extensive destruction of property, etc.) informed the later codification of war crimes in the Rome Statute.
