##### 1919

Following Word War I, the negotiators of the [Treaty of Versailles](http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/parti.htm) proposed establishing an international court to try the Kaiser and German war criminals.

Though the Kaiser was never tried, the proposal remained in Article 227 of the Treaty of Versailles.
