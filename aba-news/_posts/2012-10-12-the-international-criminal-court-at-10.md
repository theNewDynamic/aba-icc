On November 11 and 12, 2012, the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute at Washington University School of Law held an international conference commemorating the tenth anniversary of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The conference included a celebration of the memory of Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor Whitney R. Harris and his 100th birthday, as well as a day of remembrance to honor the victims of atrocity crimes. One of the panels at this distinguished conference was on US-ICC relations, shown in full in the link below, and revolved around the developments and challenges of US engagement with the ICC, past, present and future. This panel included Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the American Society of International Law; John Washburn, convenor of the American NGO Coalition for the ICC, Prof. Jordan Paust, University of Houston Law Center, and Kip Hale, director of the ABA-ICC Project. Several panelist commented on different aspects of the US’ inconsistent, yet burgeoning relationship with the ICC, including Kip Hale who pointed out that “we have to think about the U.S.-ICC relationship as larger than just the United States Government and the ICC.” The importance of United States cooperation with the ICC was commented on by several, and summarized by a video of Whitney R. Harris, in which he stated, “Civilization can no longer tolerate the commission of crimes against humanity.”


> “The ICC experience is a very important warning to the United States that if other countries care enough about a new international organization and what it is committed to do, they can do it without you. That is a very important lesson in this.”  
— John Washburn

> “Not only do we not oppose the ICC’s investigation and prosecutions in Sudan, but we support its investigation and prosecution in these atrocities.”  
— John Bellinger, as quoted by moderator

> “After 12 years I think we have reset the default on the US relationship with the court from hostility to positive engagement. In this case, principled engagement works to protect our interests to improve the outcome and to bring us renewed international goodwill.”  
— Harold Kowe, State Department Legal Advisor, quoted by moderator

> “I think we have to think about the U.S. - ICC relationship as larger than the United States government and the ICC.”  
— Kip Hale

> “If you take the long view you are looking at the prevention of armed conflicts and atrocities that ultimately do involve American treasure and blood.”  
— David Scheffer

> “The common sense of mankind demands that law shall not stop with the punishment of petty crimes by little people, it must also reach men of who possess themselves of great power and make deliberate and concerted use of it, to set in motion evils which leave no home in the world untouched.”  
— Justice Jackson, quoted by Ambassador Rapp

> “Civilization can no longer tolerate the commission of crimes against humanity”  
— Whitney R. Harris

> “We must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow”  
— Justice Jackson, quoted by Ambassador Rapp

>“The ICC needs the support of the US this great country which time and again had a decisive role in bringing about the fall of tyranny and re the rule of law. The Court needs American support morally politically materially and in other ways and it remains also my hope that one day the judges may have an American colleague on the bench.”  
— His Excellency Judge Hans Peter-Kaul
