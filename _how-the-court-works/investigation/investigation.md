For any ICC case to start, the first step is to determine whether the ICC has jurisdiction in that country or over a particular individual at all, as just discussed above.

2) To date, the most common jurisdictional trigger is a **State Party Referral**. This is where an ICC State Party refers a "situation" already within the ICC's jurisdiction for investigation, which means refers for investigation alleged atrocities that either occurred within one of the ICC's States Parties or by one of its nationals.  A State Party *cannot* refer alleged atrocities for investigations that occurred outside the ICC's jurisdiction, such as in a non-State Party's territory or by one of its nationals.

1) Another jurisdictional trigger is a **UN Security Council Referral**. This is where the UN Security Council passes a resolution referring a situation to the ICC for investigation. Unlike a State Party referral, the UN Security Council can both confer jurisdiction in a non-State Party and request the ICC investigate. Technically, the UN Security Council powers permit the ICC to have jurisdiction anywhere in the world.

3) The other jurisdiction trigger is called a ***Proprio Motu*** investigation, Latine for "on one's own initiative". This is where the ICC Prosecutor initiates an investigation, but may only legally do so in a State Party to the ICC or in a non-State Party that temporarily accepts the ICC's jurisdiction by declaration.
