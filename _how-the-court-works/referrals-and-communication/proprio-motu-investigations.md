[A]()&nbsp;*proprio motu* case (“on one’s own initiative” in Latin) is when the Prosecutor looks into alleged atrocities that have occurred either:

* in the territory or by the national of any State Party
* in the territory or by a national of a non-State Party that has accepted the ICC’s jurisdiction temporarily, during or after the conflict.


The Prosecutor must receive judicial approval from judges in order to open a formal investigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;
