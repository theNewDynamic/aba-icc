If convicted, the Trial Chambers (TC) will determine the appropriate sentence by considering a range of factors, such as the gravity of the crimes and the convicted person’s role in the crimes.

With the death penalty not an option, the TC can impose up to 30 years of imprisonment or a life imprisonment. The TC can also issue fines and/or forfeiture of proceeds, property, or assets derived directly or indirectly from the crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If the sentence and/or other punishment issued by the TC is appealed by the Office of the Prosecutor, convicted person, and/or the Victims, the Appeals Chambers has the power to uphold, reverse, or amend the sentence and/or other punishment issued.
