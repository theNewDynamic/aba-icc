The Office of the Prosecutor, Accused, and/or Victims can appeal a judgment to the Appeals Chamber (AC). In an appeal, the AC will

* review the judgment for errors of law, procedures, and/or fact; and
* hold public hearings to listen to arguments from the parties.


After deliberations in private, the AC will issue its own judgment that either:

* affirm some or all of the Trial Chamber’s (TC) judgment;
* reverse or amend some or all of the TC’s judgment; or
* order a new trial with a different TC.
