During the course of an investigation, if sufficient evidence identifies an individual as responsible for the alleged crimes, the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) may request the three-member Pre-Trial Chambers (PTC) to issue an summons (when the individual will voluntarily appear) or arrest warrant.  If satisfied that the evidence presented established reasonable grounds to believe the individual is responsible, the PTC will then issue the summons or arrest warrant.
