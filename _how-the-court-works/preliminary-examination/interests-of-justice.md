Even when the jurisdictional and admissibility requirements are met, the OTP has the discretion to determine if the case moving forward at the ICC serves the “interests of justice.” The OTP may close the case if it determines there are substantial reasons to believe a formal investigation will not help achieve justice. However, a Pre-Trial Chamber can review this decision.
