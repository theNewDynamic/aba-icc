After an individual’s initial appearance, the Pre-Trial Chambers (PTC) must hold a hearing within a reasonable amount of time to confirm or dismiss the charges presented by the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP). The PTC can either:

* Confirm the charges and send the case to the Trial Chambers for trial (whereby the individual becomes the “Accused”)
* Dismiss the charges and set the individual free
* Pause the hearing to request the OTP to produce additional evidence or change the charges with the evidence presented.


If dismissed, the OTP can provide additional evidence at a later time in order either to convince the PTC to confirm the previous charges, or start the whole process over with different charges.
