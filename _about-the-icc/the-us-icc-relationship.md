The United States of America (U.S.) is one of the most ardent supporters of international criminal justice, having played critical roles in the establishment and operations of the U.N. War Crimes Commission, the World War II tribunals at Nuremberg, Tokyo and elsewhere, as well as the modern U.N. *ad hoc* or hybrid tribunals for the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Cambodia, and Lebanon. The International Criminal Court (ICC), as the only permanent international criminal tribunal with a mandate to investigate and prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression, is the preeminent achievement in international criminal justice. While the U.S. played a central role in the establishment of the Rome Statute and other constituent documents of the ICC, it remains a non-State Party.
