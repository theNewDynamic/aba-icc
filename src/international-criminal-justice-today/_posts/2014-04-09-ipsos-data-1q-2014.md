{% comment %}so maybe we can call the ipsos data with a category conditional rather than explicit include
make the explicit include is the date e.g. '2014-04-09'{% endcomment %}


This poll comprises findings from an Ipsos online poll:
Fieldwork period: February 21-24, 2014

The survey interviewed a national sample of 1,005 adults

These slides also contain some data filtered on just those respondents reporting that they know ‘A great deal’, ‘A fair amount’, or ‘ A little bit’ about the ICC at Q1 (cutting out those who say they know ‘Nothing at all’). This reduced the filtered base size to 379, and is referred to in the data as ‘Aware of ICC’ audience.

Weighting then employed to balance demographics and ensure that the sample's composition reflects that of the U.S. adult population according to Census data and to provide results intended to approximate the sample universe. 

Statistical margins of error are not applicable to online polls because they are based on samples drawn from opt-in online panels, not on random samples that mirror the population within a statistical probability ratio. 

All sample surveys and polls may be subject to other sources of error, including, but not limited to coverage error, and measurement error.
